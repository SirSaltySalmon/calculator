# calculator.exe
A calculator app made in Godot that plays an effect whenever 67 is typed or appears in the result.

## Features
- Basic calculator (without scientific functions)
- Plays unobstrusive sound and visual effect when "6" and "7" is directly typed one after another, or when the sequence "67" appears in result
- Typing by directly inputting text or by pressing on buttons, via clicking or focus with arrow keys
- Catches errors with a cute message if inputted sequence cannot be evaluated

## Legal
This project is made for recreational and educational purposes only. I do not make any money from this. I do not own the small audio snippet used; it was extracted from [Skrilla - Doot Doot (67)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnygT6ANLzQ). I also do not own the visual effects; it originated from CapCut.
